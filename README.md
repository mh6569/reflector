## 1. Problem Statement

### The Blank Page Problem
Journaling is proven to improve mental health, yet most people struggle to maintain the habit:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Blank page anxiety** | Users don't know where to start |
| **Event logging vs. reflection** | Entries lack emotional depth |
| **No pattern recognition** | Users miss insights about their own behavior |
| **Privacy concerns** | Fear of intimate thoughts being exposed |

### Our Solution
A gentle, intelligent journaling system that:
- **Prompts with context** — AI-generated questions based on recent entries
- **Analyzes locally** — Sentiment, emotion, and theme detection on-device
- **Visualizes patterns** — Mood trends, theme correlations, and emerging topics
- **Respects privacy** — Zero external data transmission; encrypted at rest
