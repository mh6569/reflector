## 1. Problem Statement

### The Blank Page Problem
Journaling is widely recognized as beneficial for mental health, but most people struggle to sustain the habit:

| Challenge | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Blank page anxiety | Users don’t know where to begin |
| Event logging vs. reflection | Entries lack emotional depth and intention |
| No pattern recognition | Users overlook trends or recurring themes in their own lives |
| Privacy concerns | Fear of intimate thoughts being exposed or stored externally |
